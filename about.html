            <h2>Academic Interests & Career Goals</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Adam and I'm a graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science. Over the past 5 years, I've had the opportunity to use my education in various different roles of environmental work.
            I spent the first 2.5 years out of school working as an Environmental Scientist on various projects including Phase I ESAs, groundwater investgations, and hazardous materials testing. The remainder of my experience has been involved in the world of
             Environmental Health. At the Virginia Department of Health, I've spent the last 3 years investing thousands of animal bites, conducting site and soil evaluations, reviewing wastewater permit applications, and even automating various steps in the permitting process.</p>
            <p>My current goal is to enhance my technical expertise in GIS and remote sensing, with the aim of contributing to large-scale conservation and ecological restoration projects. While I've enjoyed the time spent working in Environmental Health, I'm ready to being
            tackling more diverse environmental and ecological issues, and continue to learn and grow as a professional in the process.</p>
