            <h2>Academic Interests & Career Goals</h2>
            <p class="blocktext">Hello, and welcome to my site! My name is Adam Day, and I am an environmental professional with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science from Roanoke College (2019). 
								Over the past five years, I've have applied my expertise in both private and public sector roles, gaining diverse experience in environmental consulting and environmental permitting.
								I began my career as an Environmental Scientist, conducting many Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments, as well as numerous hazardous materials sampling and analysis projects. 
								I later transitioned to the public sector where I have spent the past 3.5 years working as an Environmental Health Associate and Senior Environmental Health Specialist with the Virginia Department of Health.
								In these roles, I have led thousands of animal bite investigations for rabies vector control, performed numerous site and soil evaluations for residential wastewater system and private wells,
								reviewed consultant-submitted permit applications for regulatory compliance, and streamlined administrative workflows through process automation, bringing an archaic paper-based system into a more modern and efficient electronic-based system.</p>
            
			<p>With a strong foundation in environmental science, I am now focused on advancing my technical expertise with GIS and remote sensing to support more diverse conservation and ecological restoration initiatives.
				This portfolio showcases my geospatial projects, highlighting my skills in ArcGIS Pro, spatial modeling and analysis, and cartographic visualizations. My goal is to apply these tools to address complex environmental
				challenges while continuously growing as a professional.</p>
			<hr align="center"/>	
			<p>Outside of GIS and work, I enjoy hiking and camping, which have certainly attributed my interest in mapping the natural world. My hiking buddy Daisy (pictured in my avatar) and I are fortunate in that we live right off the Appalachian Trail. It provides so many opportunities 
			to get out and see the natural world in all its wonder. I'm also into weightlifting-it's taught me a lot about self-discipline and having a goal-orientated mindset. On top of all this, really enjoy spotting and watching wildlife, particularly groundhogs...</p>	
				
			<p>Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaboration. A copy of my resume is available below.</p>
