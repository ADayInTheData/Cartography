      <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by! I’m Adam Day, an Environmental Professional with a background in conservation science and a passion for the natural world. 
	After earning my B.S. in Environmental Studies from Roanoke College in 2019, I spend the last five years applying my skills across both the private 
	and public sectors.</p>
	  
	<p>I began as an Environmental Scientist, conducting Phase I & Phase II Environmental Site Assessments along with hazardous material investigations 
	involving asbestos, lead-based paint, and mold. Over time, I transitioned into the public sector joining the Virginia Department of Health, where 
	I’ve spent the past three and half years working in environmental permitting and field investigations.</p>
	  
	<p>My work history is quite diverse and has ranged from site and soil evaluations for residential wastewater and well systems, investigating 
	thousands of animal bites related to rabies vector control, reviewing permit applications for residential wastewater and well systems, permit 
	writing for residential wastewater and well systems, and offering technical and regulatory guidance with these systems. I also helped modernize 
	our permit renewal system by developing automated workflows to replace an outdated, paper-based system with a paperless, email-based system.</p>
		
	<p>In 2025, I completed a fully online, one-year GIS Certification Program (16 credit hours) through <a href="https://www.humboldt.edu/"</a> Cal Poly, Humboldt | California</a>, 
	where I explored a wide range of geospatial concepts, 
	developed technical proficiency with GIS tools including ArcGIS Pro and ENVI, and learned to design clear and effective cartographic maps. 
	This experience deepened my interest in conservation-based spatial analysis and encouraged me to continue growing professionally. I’m currently further 
	developing my skills by learning QGIS and Python to further complement my GIS workflows, supporting more advanced environmental work.</p>
	
    <p>This portfolio showcases my work across three key areas: <strong>Geospatial Analysis</strong>, <strong>Cartographic Design</strong>, and <strong>Remote Sensing</strong>. 
	My projects explore topics like habitat fragmentation, water quality, land use change, and more.</p>
    </section>
	
    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>I'm looking for opportunities to apply these skills in a broader environmentally-focused role (Environmental Planner, GIS Specialist, Land Use Planner, etc.) 
	  which will allow me to analyze and visualize environmental data in support of conservation efforts, land use projects, and sustainable development.</p>
