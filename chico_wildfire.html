    <h2>Mapping The 2024 Park Fire; Chico, CA</h2>
    <p><em>Adam Day | April, 2025</em></p>

    <section>
      <h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>In July 2024, Chico California saw its largest wildlife of the 2024 wildfire season. The fire presumably began as an act of arson and 
	  quickly grew into a regional threat which saw several emergency response efforts including closure of public lands, evacuation of local 
	  communities, and fire suppression efforts which were ultimately defied by fire. The purpose of this analysis is to provide a measurable 
	  impact of the burned area in Chico, CA on July 27, 2024, three days after the initial ignition.
	  Landsat 8 Satellite imagery of the impacted area taken on July 27, 2024 was used for this analysis.</p>
	  
	  <p>The Landsat 8 project provides free, publicly available data which includes imagery generated from a passive sensor capturing 9 spectral bands 
	  ranging from 0.4 µm up to 1.38 µm. This range captures the Coastal Aerosol band, the full visible spectrum, along with the NIR, SWIR 1 & @, along 
	  with Panchromatic and Cirrus bands. These bands are captured in 30m spatial resolution with a 12-bit radiometric resolution and are cycled through 
	  a 16-day temporal resolution providing accurate and up-to-date imagery data making it ideal for this analysis.</p>

		<p>The area in red shown above encompasses the total burned area on July 27, 2024. This area measures approximately 344,053 acres of land and would continue to grow throughout 
		the following days as made evident by the visibly active burning areas along various points of the perimeter of the area.

      <h3>4. DISCUSSION</h3>
	  <p>As discussed above, spatial resolution has an enormous impact on the use and application of imagery used for remote sensing projects. A higher degree of resolution provides 
	  higher quality images which translates to higher quality data and a better analysis in the long run. For general land analysis projects, a lower spatial resolution as seen on 
	  the MODIS might be sufficient for the analysis depending on the parameters of the project and likely leads to less data storage requirements. A higher resolution image, such as 
	  Landsat 8 or PlanetScope might be more suitable, or required, for a detailed land cover analysis which might include vegetation health, soil conditions, or as in this study,
	  wildfire impacts. NAIP imagery takes this application one step further as it has the highest spatial resolution of all the aforementioned satellites making it a suitable candidate 
	  for literal on the ground vegetation conditions.</p>
	  

	  <p>With the Landsat 8 image of Figure 1 above taken into consideration, accuracy in an image with a 30x30 spatial resolution could lead to slightly inaccurate data of the wildfire
	  boundaries due to a lower resolution than when compared with a satellite with a higher resolution such as the PlanetScope project. For this analysis, the Landsat 8 image provides 
	  sufficient enough data to delineate the extent of the wildfire without the loss of much quality. Additionally, with a larger number of spectral bands, filtering of smoke by use of a 
	  false-color composite makes delineation that much easier.</p>
		
	  <p>One final aspect of these satellites to take into consideration is the size of each of the images. In general, higher resolution, higher quality images will have a higher demand for 
	  storage requirements as each image holds more data than that of a lower resolution. Depending on the analysis type, and goals of the analysis, it might be better suited to use a lower 
	  resolution image than a higher resolution image based on total land area being analyzed. With higher resolution images, an increase of land area directly increases the number of images 
	  and storage space. Lower resolution images with a large area footprint will require less images and therefore less data storage requirements. Taking into storage requirements and 
	  processing power of the machine are integral to any future analysis.</p>
