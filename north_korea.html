    <h2>Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Assessment of South Hwanghae, North Korea (2013-2023)</h2>
    <p><em>Adam Day | May, 2025</em></p>

    <section>
      <h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>North Korea is an East Asia country located on the northern half of the Korean Peninsula. The Democratic 
	  People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), the governing body of North Korea, is a totalitarian dictatorship led by 
	  the Kim family who see full control over all of North Korea’s internal government operations and affairs, 
	  including their agricultural sector. The DPRK have historically faced agricultural challenges, which are in 
	  part due to their centrally planned economy & agricultural sector. Collectivization of farm crops are at the 
	  core ideology for the nation, and one which has impacted the DPRK’s forests, soil fertility, and natural waters. 
	  The DPRK’s collective agriculture-based policies discourages single and double cropping rotation systems,
	  which have a proven history to be a sound, low-cost means to boost soil fertility, due to the fear of failure 
	  to meet grain production targets set by the government (Michalk, & Mueller, (2003). In addition to this, 
	  widespread reliance on firewood and coal of household heating has led to extensive deforestation throughout 
	  the country. As Tenebaum put it “The nation is mired in a morass of intertwined environmental problems.” (Tenebaum, 2005). </p>
		
		<p>The environmental impacts of deforestation are widespread throughout the DPRK and are further accelerated 
		due to the natural heavy rain season occurring during the warmer summer months. Heavy rainfall, coupled with 
		cleared slopes steeper than 20 degrees results in heavy amounts of soil erosion and loss of topsoil (Tenebaum, 2005).
		These factors combined have led to severe soil fertility deterioration throughout the nation. The environmental 
		pressures placed on North Korea,  along with the agricultural inefficacies of the DPRK led to a wide-spread 
		famine in the mid to late 1990s, leaving hundreds of thousands of dead, and millions more food insecure.</p>
		
		<p>Given the environmental and agricultural challenges concerns that North Korea faces, the country is a prime 
		candidate for an agricultural analysis through the use of remote sensing. This analysis aims to measure the 
		agricultural productivity of one of North Korea’s most important agricultural provinces using satellite 
		imagery combined with the Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The South Hwanghae province is 
		historically one of North Korea’s most prominent agricultural sectors. With growing seasons typically 
		lasing from June to August, this area and time period make it an ideal area of study for this analysis. 
		Landsat 8/9 is equipped with imagery containing spatial resolutions of 30m across 10 bands, 
		a radiometric resolution between 12-14 bit, and a temporal resolution of 16 days, making it suitable 
		for source data.</p>


      <p>The 2010 Botetourt County Comprehensive Plan states that Agricultural and Forested Lands
		account for approximately 69.1% of total land cover in 2010. Agricultural practices have been the
		main economic driver historically in Botetourt County for a number of years. As stated in the plan,
		this rural nature of the county has become an attractive location for residential development over
		time and was expected to have impacts on conversion of agricultural land into medium-density
		suburban development. Therefore, it is to be expected that with the increase in demand for
		development, clearing of land for said development will result in habitat fragmentation over a
		period of time.</p>

 
    <section>
      <h3>2. METHODS</h3>
      <p>This analysis began with the collection of Landsat 8 Level-1 images for the South Hwanghae Province of 
	  North Korea, with a focus specifically on the Chaeryŏng-Anak river basin valley. Using USGS EarthExplorer 
	  data sets, two time points were captured for this area: August 22, 2023 and August 18, 2023, both within 
	  the June-August peak growing season.  Cloud cover thresholds were set to <30%. </p>
		
		<p>Both image files were imported into ENVI for further processing. To reduce processing and storage space 
		demand, a Region of Interest (ROI) was defined around the area of study, encompassing approximately 
		450km2 of the area. Imagery was then subset to this ROI prior to ENVI processing. Radiometric calibration 
		was performed on both images using Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance to correct for atmospheric scattering. 
		Figure 2 and Figure 3 below show the outcome of this correction. Following the TOA correction, a cloud mask  
		was generated for each image with kernel size set to 1 and cloud probability threshold set to 95%. With both 
		images radiometrically calibrated and cloud masked, NDVI values for both years was calculated using 
		ENVI’s Spectral Indices toolbox.</p>
		
		<p>With the NDVI results calculated, five NDVI value ranges were created and color coded using the following parameters shown in Table 1:</p>

		<p>Figure 4 and Figure 5 below show the NDVI results with cloud mask and classifications for the ROI in 2013 and 2023.</p>

		<p>The delta NDVI (dNDVI) values for each year was calculated to determine changes in vegetation health between both years. 
		This was conducted in ENVI by using the Band Math tool, using the float(b1-b2) equation, where b1 represents the NDVI 2013 
		image and b2 represents the NDVI 2023. These values were then classified within five value ranges and color coded with results 
		shown below in Table 2:</p>

      <h3>4. DISCUSSION</h3>
	  <p>The results from this analysis share a valuable insight into the vegetation health of the Chaeryŏng-Anak river basin valley region of South Hwanghae 
	  Province between 2013 and 2023. While the mean NDVI increased slightly from 0.615 to 0.645, suggesting improvement in the vegetation 
	  health, the NDVI and dNDVI results suggests slight differences to this conclusion.</p>
	  

	  <p>From 2013 to 2023, the portion of classified land within the ‘High’ and ‘Very High’ vegetation categories fell from approximately 82% to 66%, 
	  signifying a 15.1% drop in high-quality vegetation health. Coupled with this, moderate vegetation cover in the ‘Moderate Vegetation’ decreased 
	  from 3.56% to 2.21%, or a loss of 1.35%. While low quality vegetation in the ‘Very Low’ and ‘Low Vegetation’ classes both saw a slight decrease, 
	  this could likely be the result of slight reclassification differences at the lower range levels of the NDVI scale or cloud masking 
	  artifacts created by the cloud mask.</p>
		
	  <p>These findings are supported by the dNDVI results, which found that approximately 15.5% of the ROI showed declining NDVI values where 14.82% of 
	  the values fell into the ‘Moderate Decrease’ category and 0.60% in the ‘Significant Decrease’ category. By comparison, meaningful improvement 
	  to vegetation health only amounted to 6.76% (categorized as ‘Moderate’ or ‘Significant Increase’) with the majority of the coverage area remaining stable. 
	  Ultimately, this suggests that while few ‘hot spot’ productive patches exist, the majority of the agricultural landscape within the ROI is undergoing degradation</p>


      <p>This is likely the outcome of many various factors North Korea faces including their historical deforestation efforts, poor soil management practices, 
	  and lack of sustainable agricultural practices such as utilizing crop rotation, all of which ultimately lead to a loss of soil fertility. With the South Hwanghae 
	  region being North Korea’s prime agricultural sector, the region still suffers from geographic and environmental factors which accelerate this degradation,
	  including steep slopes and periods of heavy rainfall. It is likely that a wider range of environmental factors have also influence these outcomes, 
	  such as droughts, floods or climate variability, leading to further stress of an already fragile landscape.</p>

      <p>Overall, the findings from this analysis support the conclusion that agricultural productivity within the South Hwanghae region of North Korea is facing a 
	  gradual decline of soil fertility and agricultural output. Extrapolating on these findings into the greater region of South Hwanghae, it is reasonable to 
	  conclude that wide-scale soil degradation may be taking place over a gradual period of time.
	  Future analysis could improve upon this data and conclusion by ultimately testing a large range of landscape or utilizing more frequent time period sampling 
	  such as on a yearly or 2-year cycle. Additionally, specified areas of land, such as agricultural fields, could be measured independently by utilizing ENVI’s land 
	  classification toolset, narrowing the scope of the NDVI measurements to ensure only agricultural field data is capture. Finally, future improvements to satellites 
	  and sensor data could enhance the data of this analysis, thereby reinforcing or challenging the conclusions found within this report. Ultimately, 
	  this analysis highlights the importance of long-term NDVI monitoring and its usefulness for future food security assessments in regions such as the North Korea, 
	  where ground-truth data and internal information are scarce.
