            <p>This map shows each visible Tree of Heaven and Autumn Olive tree along the Greenfield Cherry Blossom Trail as well as the footpath traveled. 
			These species were chosen as they two of the most commong invasive tree species found throughout Virginia and are abundant along this particular trail.
			This map was created using the Gaia GPS application which allowed me to collect GPS coordinates for each of the visible invasive species along this trail,
			while simultaneous recording the foot path I traveled. The GPS data was then uploaded into ArcGIS Pro along with some county provided parcel data with the outcome shown above.</p>

            <p>This map was created to show reported Black Bear Mange cases throughout Virginia from 2014-2023. 
				The map on the left shows the total number of reported Black Bear Mange cases between this time period while the map on the right 
				shows a rough timeline in the spread of Black Bear Mange throughout Virginia at three-year intervals. 
				To create this map, I contacted the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources and requested they provide any 
				Black Bear Mange data that could be used in a GIS. Although they were unable to give me exact coordinates for each 
				of the reported bears due to private property rights, they were able to provide me with yearly county level data which 
				I then symbolized in ArcGIS Pro to help visualize this data.</p>

            <p>This hobbiest map shows the areas around Middle Earth which are visible to the Eye of Sauron from the tower of Barad-dûr. 
			This map was a fun way to combine my love for Lord of the Rings with GIS by using DEM data of Middle Earth to run a viewshed analysis to 
			highlight the visible areas. By using fan-delinated GPS cooridantes for each of the towers of Mordor, Barad-dûr was selected using a typical
			select by attribute statement, and used to establish at the base point for the viewshed analysis. Since Barad-dûr stands an astonishing 1,500 meters (5,000ft),
			this height difference was compensated in ArcGIS Pro by use of the raster calculator feature, affecting the total area of Middle Earth that was visible to the Eye of Sauron.</p>

		    was imported into ArcGIS Pro and the Kernel Density Modeling feature created visual hotspots for arsons committed in 2015. This type of analysis is important for data visualization 
		    and can help determine locations best suited for resource allocation or staffing metrics.</p>

            <p>This map showcases how a Least Cost Path analysis can establish wildlife corridors, or the most cost-effective path taken given a set a parameter. In this scenario, the Wolpertinger, 
			a creature of Bavarian folklore only visible to individuals who consume copious amounts of beer, was the subject of analysis. Several fictional Wolpertinger den locations were GPS marked by 
			students in Orick California, and it was established that the Wolpertingers were traveling down to Orick from their dens during the mating seasons. My task was to find which paths the 
			Wolpertingers were taking based on their environmental preferences such as land cover type, grade of landforms, and water bodies. By taking several layers of data including land cover data, 
			DEM raster data, and hydrological feature data and combining them with the GPS den locations, the Least Cost Path feature of ArcGIS Pro established the most cost-effective path the Wolpertingers 
			would take to travel to and from their dens during the mating season.</p>

            <p>This map shows the visual differences in infrared bands using remote sensing of satellite imagery provided by the Landsat 8/9 program.The use of the Near Infrared band improves visualization of vegetation as 
		    chlorophyll has a high reflectance value in the 700 to 1300 nm range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Red is useful for visualizing human developed objects, soil, and vegetation while blue highlights water 
		    features. By including NIR into the Red bad, swapping Green for Red, and leaving Blue as Blue, this map highlights land use in the Humboldt Bay area by contrasting urban developed areas, vegetative areas, 
		    and water areas. As made evident by the map, much of the urban developed area is easily visible and ‘pops’ out of the map while not overpowering the nearby vegetation and waters/shorelines.</p>

				</a>
            <p>This map represents one of my initial significant projects in geospatial analysis. For this analysis, I examined averaged nitrogen compound data from water samples collected in Botetourt County, VA, in 2021, 
			provided by the EPA. I then integrated USGS land cover data to identify and visualize all agricultural land within the county for the same year. By comparing the EPA nitrogen data with the surrounding 
			agricultural land at each sampling point, the analysis highlights the impact of agricultural runoff on water quality. The results suggest that as the proportion of agricultural land increases around each 
			sample site, nitrogen compound concentrations in nearby tributaries also rise.</p>

		<h2>Map Title: Botetourt Land Cover and Habitat Fragmentation GIS Analysis</h2>
			<p>Published on: <em>December, 2024</em></p>
					<p>The aim of this analysis was to measure the land use change in Botetourt County, VA between 2010 and 2020. The figures listed below are the outcomes of the full GIS analysis. 
					The full paper including a literature review, methods, results, conslusion, and discussion can be found <a href="pdfs\Habitat Fragmentation & Land Use Change - Botetourt County, VA.pdf" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

							<p>Figure 1 represents the classified land cover type of Botetourt County, VA in 2010 and 2020. Using the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium database, 
							land cover data of the United States in 2010 and 2020 was added to the GIS, with Botetourt County, VA configured as the template for this data. The land cover data was then 
							reclassified into five categories to match the premise of the analysis and include: Forest, Agricultural, Urban Development (Low, Medium, and High Designations), 
							Water (including wetlands), and Grasslands. This effectively gave Botetourt County the ‘footprint’ for which the analysis was built upon.

							<h3>Natural vs Anthropogenic Land Cover Change in Botetourt County, VA: 2010 - 2020</h3>
							</a>
							
							<p>Figure 2 illustrates the classification of land cover types into two distinct categories: Natural and Anthropogenic. The objective of this classification was to highlight the extent of land that 
							remained in its natural state versus the land affected by human activity. Each of the five previous land cover classifications was assigned to one of these two groups and quantified to assess 
							the degree of change. The raster data were converted into polygons, with each polygon representing a land fragment, and both the fragment count and size were measured. The results of this analysis 
							reveal that the count of natural land cover fragments increased from 2,474 to 2,706, while the mean fragment size decreased from 42.99 to 39.24. This reduction in fragment size suggests that 
							increased fragmentation has led to smaller land patches, which could have implications for the sustainability of natural habitats.

							<p>Figure 3 represents the detected change in landcover from Natural to Anthropogenic or Anthropogenic to Natural. This analysis found that Between 2010 and 2020, 1,320.42 fragments were 
							converted from Natural to Anthropogenic land
							cover, representing 279.49 hectares of change. Compared with the Anthropogenic to Natural land
							cover type, only 956 fragments were converted resulting a total 130.66 hectares of land regenerated

							<h3>Suitable Habitat (10 Hectares of Forested Land) in Botetourt County, VA: 2010 - 2020</h3>
							</a>
							
							<p>Figure 5 is an extension from Figure 4 and shows suitable habitat areas in identified by measuring 10-hectare patches of forested areas. The analysis found that suitable habitat patch count 
							decreased from 195 patches to 191 patches from 2010 and 2020,
							which represents a total land cover area from 101,962.40 hectares in 2010 to 101,656.14 hectares
							in 2020. However, average patch size increased from 522.88 hectares to 532.23 hectares. The
							increase of the average patch size, when compared to the overall loss of the suitable habitat cover,
							could be the result of a decrease or loss in the number of smaller forested patches or the result of
							regeneration of the area between smaller and larger patches which connects them forming an

							<h3>Perimeter/Area Ratio of Suitable Habitat in Botetourt County, VA: 2010 - 2020</h3>
							</a>
							
							<p>Figure 6 measures the Perimeter-To-Area Ratio (P/A Ratio) for each fragment of suitable habitat (as established in Figure 5). The P/A Ratio is a useful tool which measures how fragmented a patch is
							by count of the edges divided by the perimeter of the patch. A higher P/A Ratio indicates more edges
							per patch and a lower P/A Ratio indicates less edges per patch. In 2010, the P/A Ratio for the
							suitable habitat (less than or equal to 10 hectares of forested land) was 133.1 and in 2020 the P/A Ratio increased
							slightly to 133.7. This increase, while minor, indicates that the number of edges per patch does
							increase over the ten-year period, suggesting that fragmentation has occurred within the ten-year
							time period. Note, Figure 6 depicts data from 2010 only, as the difference between averages from
							both years was almost negatable from a visualization standpoint. Therefore, the 2010 data is
							sufficient to visually represent both 2010 and 2020 P/A ratios.

							<h3>Average Near Distance Measurments of Suitable Habitat Fragments in Botetourt County, VA: 2010 - 2020</h3>
							
							<p>Figure 7 depicts the Average Near Distance change between suitable habitat fragments from 2010 to 2020. This measurement can be insightful to fragmentation patterns because as fragmentation
								occurs, land cover is lost thereby increasing the distance between each fragment or ‘patch’ wildlife
								use to traverse the land. In 2010 the average nearest distance measurement between suitable forest
								patches was 13.85 meters while the average dropped to 11.94 in 2020. While this reduction in the
								average does suggest that fragments are closer together after 10 years, it is ultimately contradicted
								by the land cover change data found in the earlier sections. This outcome is likely the result of more
								fragments being created over time, thus increasing the ‘spread’ of these fragments, which would
								likely impact the average nearest distance.
