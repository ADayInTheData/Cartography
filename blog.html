            <h2>Map Title: Agricultural Runoff and Water Quality</h2>
            <p>Published on: <em>October 12, 2024</em></p>
            <img src="path-to-map-image1.jpg" alt="Agricultural Runoff Map">
            <p>This map visualizes the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in various bodies of water across the region. The analysis focuses on agricultural runoff, examining its impact on local water quality. Key areas of concern include elevated nutrient concentrations near farmlands. Through GIS, I was able to overlay land use patterns with water quality data, highlighting regions where runoff is most severe.</p>

            <h2>Map Title: Forest Cover Change Over Time</h2>
            <p>Published on: <em>September 22, 2024</em></p>
            <img src="path-to-map-image2.jpg" alt="Forest Cover Map">
            <p>This map tracks the change in forest cover over the past two decades, showing areas of deforestation and regrowth. By using temporal data in GIS, I could create a detailed visualization of how forested areas have shifted, particularly in response to human development and conservation efforts.</p>

            <h2>Map Title: Urban Heat Island Effect</h2>
            <p>Published on: <em>August 15, 2024</em></p>
            <img src="path-to-map-image3.jpg" alt="Urban Heat Island Map">
            <p>This project looks at the Urban Heat Island effect in major cities. Using satellite imagery and surface temperature data, I mapped heat distribution patterns. The data highlights areas with a significant increase in temperature due to urbanization, helping to identify regions where cooling strategies could be implemented.</p>
