            <p>This map was created by plotting GPS points of each visible Tree of Heaven and Autumn Olive tree along the Greenfield Cherry Blossom Trail. These species were chosen as they two of the most commong invasive tree species found within Viriginia.</p>

            <h2>Map Title: Total Black Bear Mange Cases: Virginia 2014-2023</h2>
            <p>Published on: <em>July 21, 2024</em></p>

				alt="Total Black Bear Mange Cases: Virginia 2014-2023"/>
            <p>This map used Black Bear Mange data provided by the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources (DWR) to show the how many Virginia counties reported a case of black bear mange. The map shows the total number of reported black bear mange cases between 2014 and 2023. DWR could not provide exact GPS coordinates of each reported case as many of the cases occurred on private land.</p>

            <p>Much like the map above, this map also used Black Bear Mange data provided by the VA DWR. Unlike the totals map, this map shows the spread of black bear mange by Virginia counties from 2014 to 2023.</p>

            <h2>Map Title: Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Sites by Per Capita Income</h2>
            <p>Published on: <em>June 30, 2024</em></p>

					<img src="images/tri_sites_per_capita_income.png" 
					width="600"
					height="700"
					alt="TRI Sites by Per Capita Income" />
            <p>This project looks at EPA listed Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) sites throughout the California bay area and shows the relationship between the sites and areas based on Per Capita Income. This map highlights how areas where lower per captia income are prevelant, are also in closer proximity to TRI sites and at a higher frequency than areas with a higher per capita income.</p>

            <h2>Map Title: Humboldt Bay Sea Level Rise Areas of Impact</h2>
            <p>Published on: <em>October 02, 2024</em></p>

					<img src="images/sealevelrise_humboldtbay.png"

					alt="Humboldt Bay Sea Level Rise Areas of Impact" />
            <p>This project focused on how sea level rise would impact different areas around Humboldt Bay. By using DEM data, various raster files were created and combined to show how sea level rises of 1, 2, 5, and 10 meters would have a larger imapct area around Humboldt Bay. Maps such as these are an important tool for future flood mitigation and prevent projects.</p>

            <h2>Map Title: Eye of Sauron Viewshed Analysis</h2>

            <p>This hobbiest map shows the areas around Middle Earth which are visible to the Eye of Sauron from the tower of Barad-dur. This map was a fun way to combine my love for Lord of the Rings with GIS by using DEM data of Middle Earth to run a viewshed analysis to highlight the visible areas.</p>

            <p>The first 'aesthetic' map I worked on which features the Cascades Region in Oregon. This map was purely for cartographic reasons and is meant to showcase how visually appealing maps are to be created.</p>
